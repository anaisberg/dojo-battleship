# battleship

## Project setup
Open a bash terminal and run the following commands.
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```
Now the server is on. It should be written in the terminal something like :
   App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  - Network: http://192.168.152.83:8080/

  Note that the development build is not optimized.
  To create a production build, run yarn build.
We can now open a webpage with the [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) url and the game can run.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Run your tests
```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
